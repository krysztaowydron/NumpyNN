# Netural network using only numpy
Neural network with cross entropy as a cost function and L2 regularisation to prevent overfitting. 
It is using stochastic gradient descent to perform back propagation.
It can achieve up to 97 % accuracy on MNIST data set with right parameters.
## Requirements
Numpy - computing linear algebra

Keras - importing dataset
